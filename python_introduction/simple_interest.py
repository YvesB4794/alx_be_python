# simple_interest.py

# Step 1: Define variables
principal = 1000    # Principal amount ($1000)
rate = 0.05         # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3            # Time in years (3 years)

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest using formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the result in required format
print("The simple interest is: {interest}")
